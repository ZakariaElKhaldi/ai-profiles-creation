# AI Profiles Documentation

Welcome to the AI Profiles documentation. This comprehensive guide will help you set up, configure, and use the AI Profiles system effectively.

## Introduction

AI Profiles is a system that allows you to create AI representations of entities (individuals, companies, products, etc.) by associating them with documents and configuration. These profiles can then be queried to get AI-generated responses that reflect the knowledge contained in the associated documents.

**Key Features:**
- Create and manage multiple AI profiles
- Upload and process various document types (PDF, DOCX, TXT, etc.)
- Query profiles through web interface or API
- Configure AI behavior through system prompts and settings
- External access via API keys

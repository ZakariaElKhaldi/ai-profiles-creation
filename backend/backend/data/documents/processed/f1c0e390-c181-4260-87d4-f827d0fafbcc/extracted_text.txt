This
technical
note
summarises
the
methodology
used
to
calculate
the
number
of
people
potentially
exposed
to
ﬂooding
in
Somalia
in
the
2024
Somalia
Humanitarian
Needs
and
Response
Plan
(
HNRP
).
The
UN
OCHA
Centre
for
Humanitarian
Data
worked
with
a
wide
range
of
technical
partners
to
develop
a
methodology
that
was
then
endorsed
by
the
Somalia
ICCG
and
HCT.
Daily
FloodScan
(1998-2022)
&
WorldPop
(2020
UN
Adjusted)
raster
data
was
analysed
to
gain
understanding
of
ﬂood
conditions
across
Somalia
for
both
March-April-May
(MAM)
and
October-November-December
(OND)
seasons.
FloodScan
daily
ﬂood
fraction
Standard
Flood
Exposure
Depiction
(SFED)
was
aggregated
to
yearly
seasonal
maximum
fraction
composites
for
both
the
MAM
and
OND
seasons
for
all
years
of
historical
FloodScan
data
(1998-2022).
The
yearly
seasonal
SFED
composites
were
then
processed/reclassiﬁed
in
two
distinct
ways:
1.
Composites
reclassiﬁed
to
binary
using
a
20
percent
ﬂood
fraction
threshold.
2.
Composites
masked
to
just
remove
any
ﬂood
fraction
values
<
0.05
percent
and
the
ﬂood
fraction
(0-100
percent)
retained.
All
composites
in
both
sets
of
processed
yearly-seasonal
ﬂood
fraction
rasters
were
then
multiplied
by
the
WorldPop
(2020
UN
Adjusted)
population
estimate
raster
to
create
two
sets
of
yearly
seasonal
ﬂood
exposure
rasters.
These
were
then
aggregated
at
the
second
administrative
level
via
zonal
statistics
(sum)
to
obtain
the
estimated
population
exposure
per
district
for
each
season
across
all
years
for
each
set.
These
estimates
were
converted
to
the
percent
of
population
exposed
by
dividing
the
estimates
by
the
total
population
per
district
(from
World
Pop
raster).
The
percent
exposure
ﬁgure
was
then
applied
to
the
updated
2024
population
data
set
(UN
OCHA,
UNFPA
Methodology)
to
obtain
updated
population
exposure
estimates.
These
data
were
further
aggregated
to
administrative
level
1.
Ranges
for
exposure
were
estimated
using
percentiles
for
both
the
MAM
and
OND
seasons
per
administrative
level.
As
ECMWF
seasonal
forecast
predicts
an
above
average
precipitation
season
for
MAM
2024,
the
range
of
population
exposed
was
based
on
the
50th-95th
percentile
levels.
Since
there
was
no
available
data
to
inform
predictions
for
OND
2024,
the
25-75th
percentile
values
were
used
to
bound
the
range.
The
lower
and
upper
limits
of
the
ranges
were

calculated
at
the
administrative
level
using
all
of
the
historical
yearly
seasonal
ﬂood
exposure
estimates.
The
two
sets
of
range
estimates
were
combined
conservatively
by
taking
the
maximum
value
for
both
the
upper
and
lower
bounds
for
each
season.
